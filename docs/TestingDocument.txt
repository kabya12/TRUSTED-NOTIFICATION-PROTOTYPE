Expected: Valid channel + provider message ID + “sent”

Test 2 — Missing fields

Case: No phone, no email, no app
Expected: Backend returns 400 — No contact method available

4.3 User Acceptance Testing (UAT)

Performed by simulated bank operator:

Search customer → auto-fill fields → send test → check logs

Replay past events → check UI consistency

EDA charts load correctly

Result: Passed ✓

4.4 Regression Testing

After adding replay logic, tested:

Prediction still works

Logs still append correctly

UI components render normally

Result: Passed ✓

4.5 Stress Testing (Limited for Prototype)

Repeatedly sending 50+ test events

No crash or slowdown

Result: Passed ✓

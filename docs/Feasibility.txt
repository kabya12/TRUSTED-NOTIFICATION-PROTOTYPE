1. Feasibility Study (Trusted Notifications Project)

1.1 Technical Feasibility
Aspect	                        Evaluation
Technology Stack	        Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, Scikit-Learn — lightweight, open-source, easy to deploy.
Model Complexity	        Decision Tree model is small and explainable; inference is fast (<1 ms).
Resource Requirements	        Can run on low-spec systems (dual-core + 4GB RAM). Cloud deployment possible (Render, Railway, Streamlit Cloud).
Integration Compatibility	API-first architecture allows integration into banking systems (CRM, Notification Service, Mobile Banking App).
Data Handling	                Prototype uses synthetic training data + user-uploaded Excel/CSV datasets — feasible for offline demo.

Conclusion: Technically feasible and easy to integrate in real-world banking workflow.

1.2 Operational Feasibility
Factor          	Explanation
Ease of Use	        Streamlit UI is intuitive for non-technical staff (CRM, Risk, Operations).
Data Upload	        Supports Excel/CSV uploads, making it compatible with daily operations.
Customer Lookup 	Auto-fills customer info → reduces manual entry and human error.
Notification Testing	Supports simulation & replay — ideal for training & monitoring.

Conclusion: Operationally feasible and easily adoptable by bank teams.

1.3 Economic Feasibility
Cost Aspect	             Benefit
Software Licensing	     Free open-source tools.
Infrastructure	             Can be deployed on low-cost cloud or bank server.
Development Cost	     Low — small ML model with basic rules.
ROI	                     Reduced message retries → lower SMS cost, faster alert delivery, improved customer satisfaction.

Conclusion: Economically very viable.

1.4 Schedule Feasibility

Backend + model development: 1–2 weeks

Dashboard building: 1 week

Integration + testing: 2–3 days

Documentation + deployment: 2–3 days

Conclusion: Entire prototype can be delivered comfortably within academic timelines.

2. Risk Analysis (with Mitigation Measures)

2.1 Technical Risks
Risk	                                        Impact	                           Mitigation
Model fails due to missing features	        Wrong predictions	           Added fallback logic + input validation
Synthetic training not accurate	                Low real-world accuracy	           Retrain with real bank delivery data
API downtime	                                Users can't send notifications	   Health-check endpoint + retry strategy
Message delivery provider fails (SMS/Email)	Failed alerts	                   Fallback to alternate channel

2.2 Data Risks
Risk	                        Impact	                          Mitigation
Incorrect contact details	Message not delivered	          Backend validation + fallback
PII exposure	                Security/compliance issue	  No PII stored in logs, masked logs, CSV sanitization

2.3 Operational Risks
Risk	                                          Impact	                          Mitigation
Users misinterpret EDA insights	                  Wrong decisions	                  Add clear descriptions in dashboard
System misuse or accidental test spamming	  Flood of test events	                  Replay button confirmation (future enhancement)

2.4 Project Risks
Risk	                Impact	                Mitigation
Incomplete dataset	Weak patterns	        Auto-generated synthetic fallback dataset
Time constraints	Rushed delivery  	Modular development approach
